6. <input type="checkbox" checked> Include helpful HTML comments to make the code more friendly and easy to maintain. Ensure that your code is also formatted appropriately.
7. <input type="checkbox"> Have fun.

**TAKE IT FURTHER**

- Upload your FORM and any image(s) to a web server.
- Consider some more specific FORM elements like:

  - phone
  - email
  - numerical input
  - date
  - option groups
  - color
  - range
  - meter
  - progress

- Capture some of the user form input and output it to another page to confirm the user's order.
- Anything else you can think of…
